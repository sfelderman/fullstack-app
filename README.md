## running

`docker-compose up --build` to run

### Basic Rest :white_check_mark:

Simple rest service with a couple basic endpoints CRUD. For the moment this is a todo

Endpoints?

### Basic Docker :white_check_mark:

Simple docker container that can host the server and which requests can be made against

### Basic Database :white_check_mark:

Store some data that is slightly more complicated than what was initially created by the rest endpoints. Endpoints now call against the database instead of against local data.

### Incredibly Basic Frontend

A very basic app that allows seeing and interacting with the TODOs

### Set up Prettier

Basic prettier implementation.

### TODO

### Investigate Mocking for "Local" development

Investigate or Implement basic mocking for endpoints. Maybe use a library.

## To Be Continued

- Proxying of request to create local data store
- Act as middleware for local tests
