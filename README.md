## Running

`docker-compose up --build` to run

## Checklist of things done

- ### :white_check_mark: Basic Rest

  - Simple rest service with a couple basic endpoints CRUD. For the moment this is a todo

  - Endpoints?

- ### :white_check_mark: Basic Docker

  - Simple docker container that can host the server and which requests can be made against

- ### :white_check_mark: Basic Database

  - Store some data that is slightly more complicated than what was initially created by the rest endpoints.

  - Endpoints now call against the database instead of against local data.

- ### :white_check_mark: Incredibly Basic Frontend

  - Working create react app

- ### :white_check_mark: Set up Prettier

- ### ESLINT setup

  - Get it integrated and working with prettier

- ### Hookup viewing live TODOs

  - The get endpoints

- ### Hookup editing live TODOs

  - all the endpoints

- ### Use Fetch hook

  - could make custom use fetch hook

- ### Testing

  - basic testing coverage
  - can be expanded upon later

## Testing

- component library?
- storybook?
- mocked data ui tests

### Investigate Mocking for "Local" development

Perhaps look into some type of testing framework for hitting the mocked endpoints like cypress (or look into the DFP in a box :) )

## Progressive Web App

- mobile friendly
- service workers and offline support
  - might be something cool to look into for testing

## To Be Continued

- Proxying of request to create local data store
- Act as middleware for local tests
